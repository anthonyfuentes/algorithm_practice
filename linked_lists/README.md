# Linked List Algorithms

## Info

* See the [Linked List Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list) for a good explanation about what linked
  lists are
* A basic Node struct is provided in the create_linked_list.rb file
  - You may use another implementation but it should maintain the same interface
* The example groups are listed in approximate order of difficulty, so I
  would suggest satisfying them in top-down order
  - The later example groups depend on the algorithms for creating linked lists, so be sure to implement those first
* Don't peek into the linked_list_helper.rb file unless you're looking for
  answers
