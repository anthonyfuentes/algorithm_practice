# Practice Implementing Algorithms

## Install

1. Fork this repo
2. Clone the fork to your machine

## Practice
1. Change RSpec example groups to active
  - Remove ```before { skip }``` from the describe block you'd like to
  implement the solution(s) for
2. Implement an algorithm that satisfies the specs
3. Repeat

### Optional

* To get the most out of these practices, I  suggest writing out your solutions on paper or a whiteboard and only running the code after you've tested your solution with a couple of examples.
