## Practice Implementing Algorithms

### Instructions

* Fork then clone this repo
* Change RSpec example groups to active
  - Remove ```before { skip }``` from the describe block you'd like to
  implement the solution(s) for
* Implement algorithm that satisfies the specs
* Repeat

### Optional

* To get the most out of these practices, I would suggest writing out
  your solutions on paper or a whiteboard and debugging there as well
